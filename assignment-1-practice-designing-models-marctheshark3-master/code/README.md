## Smart City Calorie Counting Grocery List Model

Will start out by developing the appropraite library of information.
Asking the user to choose elements out of that library. 

'''
Meal_name=[['Chicken & Waffles', 'Cheese Omelet', 'Cereal', 'Yogurt', 'fruit']
cal=[1030,358, 307, 218, 100]
ingredients=[['chicken, waffles, syrup, butter'],['egg, cheese, oil'],['milk,granola, cereal'],['yougrt, granola'],['banana,strawberries, granola, blueberries']]
Meal_Lib = [Meal_name,cal,ingredients,cereal]

meal_user= input("What would you like to have for breakfast? \n" ' A) Chicken & Waffles, B) Cheese Omelet, C) Cereal, D) Yogurt, E) fruit)

x=(meal_user)

z = 0
#need to make a for loop so that this make a list for 7 days for bfast.
for ease I will just use the entire list of meal_user for 5 days.

	if 'a' in x:
            a = 'Chicken & Waffles' 
   	        print("You have chosen" ,a ,"as your Meal")
   	        weekly_list.append(a)
   	 elif 'b'in x:
            b = 'Cheese Omelet'
            print("You have chosen" ,b ,"as your Meal")
            weekly_list.append(b)
    	elif 'c' in x:
        	c = 'Cereal'
            print("you have chosen" ,c ,"as you Meal")
         	weekly_list.append(c)
  	 	elif 'd' in x:
  	        d = 'Yogurt'
  	        print("you have chosen" ,c ,"as you Meal")
  	        weekly_list.append(d)
  		elif 'e' in x:
        	e = 'Fruit'
   	        print("you have chosen" ,c ,"as you Meal")
   	        weekly_list.append(e)

Need to make a for-loop to continue to add the more food to the library list
