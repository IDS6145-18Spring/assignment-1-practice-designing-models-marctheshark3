## Smart City Grocery List Simulation

The simulation type to be used will be discrete based.

This type of simulation was chosen because there are finite amount of events that are taking place inorder to make the final grocery list. Addttionally the user is frequently asked to input daily calories burned, as well as the calories eaten which is calculated from meals chosen initially in the process.

The simulation will be conducted by first prompting the user which meals they would like to eat. After the user decides the system generates the grocery list for the week, the calorie count, and the recipe. The system will also ask the user every day how many calories they have burned to monitor weight gain or loss. The system will do this for a month and tally the calories burned and taken to inform the user on their past decisions. For instance if the user is consistantly taking more calories per week, the system will inform the user and suggest other meals. The goal is to save people time from shopping for groceries and finding recipes, as well as keep track of the users calorie count as long as they use the system.
