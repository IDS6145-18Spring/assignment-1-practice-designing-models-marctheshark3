## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

* As cities of the future become bigger, with more interuptions, not everyone will have the time to enjoy a healthy home cooked meal while staying with in the budget. Going to the grocery store with a list is always ideal, and having an idea of what youre going to eat for the week is also helpful but some people like students certainly dont have time to do that all of time. It would be so much easier if there was a system in place that did that but also kept track of the important data that could be recorded. Calorie count especially is something that is important for weight loss or weight gain depending on the users needs. The user is also able to remove any ingredients in case if there are any dietary restrictions. The motivation of the user to use this would be for: better quality of food to cook at home, budgeting at the grocery store, compiling list of items from dinner dishes, calorie monitoring, send weekly list to grocery store for later pick-up.


* A real world example of this could be seen from weight watcher meals. With these meals users, pick out a variety of meals which are later sent for consumption. Unfortunetly these arent home-made meals, with out fresh ingredients. The calories are also pre-calculated and the user just tallies them, and takes the difference with the calories they burned to figure out if they are gaining or losing weight.

* As humans have evolved so has their system of obtaining food, from hunter gatherer origins to today's grocery stores. This proposed system will define the way future humans quickly and efficiently manage their time and sustain healthy diets, automating and stream lining an already billion dollar industry: food retail. Addtionally becoming more aware about ones food intake is vital to our health, and with that being said if someone uses this system they will become more aware of their calorie intake and more likely to achieve the goal in weight loss or gain.


## Requirements (Experimental Design)

* The system shall prompt the user which meals they would like to eat for the week.

* The user shall give the input of how many meals that will need to be prepared for the week.

* A meal shall be defined as something eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner , or a snack.

* The system shall have a library of recipes of meals ranging from all types of cultures ideally.

* With in this library, shall contain the quanitity of each ingredient in the recipe. 

* Each ingredient shall have the respective calories information tied along with it.

* The user has the ability to add or subtract ingredients, and generate the total calorie count.

* The system will store the users input for the weekly calories burned for general activity or working out.

* The system will verify the constraints given by the user, and generate the meals for the week. 

* The user will accept or change the meals as needed, if the user doesnt want a particular meal, another meal will be generated for the user to approve or not.

* Once accepted by the user, the system will generate the daily calorie count, and the grocery list.

* The system will have an account tied to the user.

The user has the option to send their weekly list to their local paritipating grocery stores for local pick-up or delivery to their home.


(remove: You should start by specifying a set of requirements. I specified a topic Smart Cities but what exactly does that mean-  you should practice formulating your own set of requirements and an experiment. Define a hypothesis of a problem cities face and how a smart city would possibly help alleviate this issue. This helps you think about your problem communication and system objectives inputs, functions, and outputs - they should be clearly specified.)


## Smart City (My Problem) Model

(remove: add a high-level overview of your model, the part below should link to the model directory markdown files)
(remove: Look at the [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) for how to structure this part of Part 2 for each diagram. Only the Object diagram has the template, the rest are blank. )
